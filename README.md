# Katamari Ecosystem

Welcome to the **Katamari Ecosystem**, a modular system designed to offer a flexible, end-to-end, event-driven architecture for handling distributed workloads, data pipelines, message queuing, serverless functions, real-time UI rendering, and much more. This ecosystem combines multiple components working together seamlessly to provide a complete infrastructure for modern, scalable, and data-driven applications.

## Key Components of the Katamari Ecosystem

The **Katamari Ecosystem** consists of the following key components:

1. [KatamariDB](docs/KatamariDB.md): 
   - A file-based, highly flexible key-value store inspired by MongoDB and Redis, using Elasticsearch-like queries.
   - Supports **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)** for advanced transactional operations and provides basic **ORM** capabilities for easy data access.

2. [KatamariPipelines](docs/KatamariPipelines.md): 
   - A pipeline execution framework to manage ETL processes and real-time data streaming.
   - Integrates with **KatamariDB** and **KatamariLambda** to efficiently process and move data through event-driven workflows.

3. [KatamariMQ](docs/KatamariMQ.md): 
   - A message queue system that distributes jobs to workers, manages **data sharding** for large datasets, and sends Lambda functions for distributed execution.
   - Includes both server and client implementations, enabling workload distribution, real-time processing, and clustering of services.

4. [KatamariLambda](docs/KatamariLambda.md): 
   - A serverless compute platform designed to handle event-driven workloads, with capabilities for scalable function execution.
   - Enables you to define, schedule, and execute functions across distributed environments, tightly integrated with **KatamariMQ** for task management.

5. [KatamariUI](docs/KatamariUI.md): 
   - An asynchronous UI framework integrated with FastAPI and WebSockets, enabling real-time updates, dynamic page rendering, and interactive components.
   - Features theming, notifications, and real-time components like charts, forms, tables, making it ideal for dashboards and admin interfaces.

6. [KatamariCharts](docs/KatamariCharts.md): 
   - A charting component of the ecosystem that supports **Chart.js** and **Matplotlib** for generating rich data visualizations.
   - Easily integrates with **KatamariUI** to provide real-time visual insights and historical data visualization.

7. [KatamariAggregation](docs/KatamariAggregation.md):
   - A dynamic metric aggregation engine that works on top of **KatamariDB** and **KatamariORM**.
   - It supports real-time and historical data aggregation, enabling users to define custom metrics dynamically and compute them over streaming and stored data.

## Getting Started

To get started with the **Katamari Ecosystem**, clone the repository, and explore the individual components inside the `docs/` directory for detailed usage instructions and examples.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gddisney/katamari.git
```

### Running Demos

Inside the **demos/** directory, you'll find several sample applications and projects that demonstrate the capabilities of the ecosystem. These include:

- **WordPress Clone**: A CMS showcasing **KatamariUI** and **KatamariDB** integration.
- **Twitter Clone**: A real-time social media platform using **KatamariMQ** and **KatamariLambda**.
- **News RSS Aggregator**: A data aggregation pipeline built with **KatamariPipelines**.
- **Tabulae Clone**: A data processing and visualization app using **KatamariAggregation** and **KatamariCharts**.

Each demo showcases how to integrate and utilize multiple components of the **Katamari Ecosystem** in real-world scenarios.
